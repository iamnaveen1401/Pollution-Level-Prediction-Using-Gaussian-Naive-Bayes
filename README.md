# 🌍 Pollution Level Prediction Using Gaussian Naive Bayes

## 📘 Overview
This project focuses on predicting air pollution levels using the **Gaussian Naive Bayes** algorithm.  
It analyzes environmental factors such as **temperature**, **humidity**, and **air quality index (AQI)** to classify pollution severity.

## 📊 Dataset
- The dataset contains various environmental attributes like temperature, humidity, and pollutant concentration.
- Target variable: Pollution level category (e.g., Low, Moderate, High).

## 🧠 Algorithm Used
- **Gaussian Naive Bayes** (best suited for continuous numerical data)

## ⚙️ Steps Involved
1. Load and explore the dataset  
2. Handle missing or inconsistent values  
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets  
4. Train the **GaussianNB** model  
5. Evaluate performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report  

## 📈 Results
- Model predicts pollution levels effectively using Gaussian Naive Bayes.  
- Provides insights into how environmental conditions affect air quality.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## 💡 Key Insight
Gaussian Naive Bayes is efficient for continuous environmental data and provides fast, interpretable results for pollution classification.
